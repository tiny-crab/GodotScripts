# GodotScripts
Collection of reusable scripts and scenes for Godot projects.

Add as a submodule to your Godot git project using `git submodule add https://github.com/tiny-crab/GodotScripts.git shared_utils`
Be careful about the directory that you use to load the submodule. A lot of resources rely on that directory name for their dependencies
and that could break what resources already exist.
